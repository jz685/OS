downloaded images stores in subdirectory "images": created in current working directory of the "client"   program


download.html: created in the current dir of "client" program
	list the "names" of all downloaded files with "hyperlinks" to the "full size" images.
	  Additionally,   “Checksum   match”   or   “Checksum   mismatch”   must   be   displayed  
next to each filename   depending on the result of the   checksum   comparison.   (Note:   If,   for   a  
particular file there is a checksum   mismatch, you do not need to provide   a   link   to   the   full size  
image,   since   the   image   is   probably   corrupted).

"catalog.csv" format: filename, size, checksum(filename has to be stripped to the last,
use "provided API"(in "mad5_test.c") to compute "checksum")
